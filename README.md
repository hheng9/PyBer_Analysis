## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to use Matplotlib to ccreate line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box & whisker plots to analyze the data for the Pyber ride share apps to compare ride fares, different cities, and types of communities. We can format the necessary information to better visualize the chart coding output by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors if needed. We can also determine the mean, median, and mode using Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy statistics to gather the requested Pyber data and display the information accordingly.

## Results
### There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:
