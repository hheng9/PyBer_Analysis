# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to use Matplotlib to create line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, bubble charts, pie charts, and box & whisker plots to analyze the data for the Pyber ride share apps to compare ride fares, different cities, and types of communities. We can format the necessary information to better visualize the chart coding output by adding titles, axes labels, legends, and custom colors if needed. We can also determine the mean, median, and mode using Pandas, Numpy, and SciPy statistics to gather the requested Pyber data and display the information accordingly.

## Results
### We begin generating our data by importing the correct infomation from the provided ride and city CSV files. A dataframe is created to gather data on total ride counts, total drivers, amount of ride fares, and averages fares per drivers & rides. We can see from the image below that the urban communities have a cheaper rate per driver & rides with more total rides & drivers available resulting in the total fare being the highest among the three communities. Being in the rural areas caused an increase to the rates per driver & ride due to insufficient amount of drivers available resulting in the lowest outcome for total rides & fares. The median between the three communities came out to be the suburban community with more totals then the rural areas but less totals then urban areas.
